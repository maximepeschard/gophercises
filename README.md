# Gophercises

My solutions to the series of exercises from [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com), as an attempt to learn a bit of Go.

## Running

The code for each exercise is contained in the corresponding `N_exercise_name` subdirectory, where `N` is the exercise number.

To build and run the code for an exercise :

```sh
# in `N_exercise_name` subdirectory
$ go build -o bin/the_binary_name && ./bin/the_binary_name
```
